# Disease Prediction Model
 This project is a machine learning-based disease prediction system that uses a Gradient Boosting Classifier and TF-IDF vectorization to predict diseases based on user-reported symptoms. The model is trained on a dataset containing the 100 most common diseases and their associated symptoms, allowing users to input their symptoms and receive a ranked list of potential diagnoses.


#### Disclaimer
This model is not intended to provide medical advice or diagnosis. While the model has been trained to recognize common patterns in symptom data and provides probabilistic predictions, it is not 100% accurate and should not be relied upon as a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
The predictions generated by this model are for informational purposes only and should be used with caution. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider if you have concerns about your health or symptoms.
