# Disease Prediction Model
## This project is a machine learning-based disease prediction system that uses a Gradient Boosting Classifier and TF-IDF vectorization to predict diseases based on user-reported symptoms. The model is trained on a dataset containing the 100 most common diseases and their associated symptoms, allowing users to input their symptoms and receive a ranked list of potential diagnoses.
